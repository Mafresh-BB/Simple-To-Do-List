# To-Do List App

A simple to-do list application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app allows you to add tasks, mark them as complete, and delete them. All tasks are stored in your browser's localStorage, ensuring they persist even after you close your browser.

## Features

- **Add Tasks:** Easily add new tasks to your list.
- **Complete Tasks:** Mark tasks as completed by clicking on them.
- **Delete Tasks:** Remove tasks when they are no longer needed.
- **Persistent Storage:** Uses localStorage to keep your tasks saved between sessions.
- **Modern, Responsive Design:** Styled with a contemporary look and feel that works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Files

- **index.html:** The main HTML file that provides the structure of the app.
- **styles.css:** The CSS file that contains the modern styling for the app.
- **script.js:** The JavaScript file that handles task logic and interacts with localStorage.
